# Leetemplate
This project comes from my daily hobby of practising Leetcode. After finished solving around 200 problems, I somehow realized those problems follow a set of patterns. 
In order to better organise my knowledge and make those 'patterns' tangible, I started writing them down.

This project does not contain any or solve any Leetcode problems directly, but it is a summary of common algorithm and data-structures. As long as
you understand those **cores**, you can use them to efficiently solve problems.

Another goal of this project is to offer a set of algorithm/data-structure **template** with a decent code quality, so they can be used in production services, helping 
developers to solve some real problems in their daily work. That is also why the focus of this project is not purely showing the theory of algorithms, but also
emphasize the code usability.
